<p><strong>1.1</strong><strong> FOCUS AREA: </strong></p>
<p>To find the value of truth table of the given expression.</p>
<p><strong>1.2 About the Experiment: </strong></p>
<p><strong>Truth Table:</strong></p>
<p>Logic gates are the basic building blocks of any digital system.
It is an electronic circuit having one or more than one input and only one output. 
The relationship between the input and the output is based on a certain logic.
Based on this, logic gates are named as AND gate, OR gate, NOT gate etc.</p>
<p><strong>Learning Objectives:</strong></p>
<p>To display the truth table of the given logical expression.</p>
